# R/a/dio API Documentation
R/a/dio doesn't version its API, but could in future. The current base URL is **`https://r-a-d.io/api`**.
Prepend this to every method here.

# Response types
Every object returned by the API (with the exception of errors, see below) returns two objects: `main` and `meta`.
Meta is a short object returning information about the current request, and available routes (as well as our stream URL).
Responses will only detail the *main* object.


# PUT + DELETE Usage
PUT and DELETE are not available in most browsers, so Symfony2 will obey the `_method` POST parameter, set to either `PUT` or `DELETE` for this.


# Current Info [/]
The main object returns an absolute monster of a response. This is cached every 1 second as it is time-sensitive.
In general you should only really need this API response if you want to make a status display for R/a/dio.
Any keys not mentioned below is either obsolete or subject to change.
