R/a/dio - https://r-a-d.io
==========================

R/a/dio's site, open-sourced. This is a heavy work in progress.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/R-a-dio/site.png?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/R-a-dio/site)


Why? I thought you were doing it in python?
------------------------------------------

We've been "doing it in python" for over a year now. The current implementation is pretty shockingly coded (but hey, it works), and a few decisions for the site were "interesting" (read: horribly insecure if the code was open-sourced), so we've never had it on github.

So [@ameliaikeda](https://twitter.com/ameliaikeda) (Amelia/Chitose) decided to completely redo the site from scratch.

The site is built in Laravel with a bunch of support libraries (see `composer.json`), History.js, jQuery and some supporting jQuery libraries

Issues
------

Create an issue here if you experience problems with the site when it has launched (until then, keep them to critical-looking bugs in the beta site).

To contact the dev(s), ping Chitose or Vin on IRC (#r/a/dio @ irc.rizon.net) or on Twitter [@ameliaikeda](https://twitter.com/ameliaikeda)
